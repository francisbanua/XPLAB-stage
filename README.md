# XPLAB Stage

These are the programs created during the stage at XPLAB (12/06/23 - 30/06/23). They were developed by me and another student, with the assistance of two tutors. All programs were written using the POWER-KI language and the POWER-KI Workbench.

### ardu-dist-01.pwk
###### 26/06/23 - 27/06/23
#### This program shows the distance from an object and multiplies it by a number. This uses an ultrasonic sensor configured with Arduino and sends to the POWER-KI program the distance value, which will be written after "Distance:". The user can multiply this value by a number inserted in a textbox, which will be sent to Arduino after the click of a button. So with POWER-KI we can receive data from Arduino and also send data to Arduino.

### diario.pwk
###### 27/06/23 - 29/06/23
#### This program is a school diary that allows students to manage grades, the school weekly timetable, subjects, and events. All data is saved in an SQL database.
#### When the program starts, the student can see a table displaying the weekly event summary with columns for each day of the week. Another table is provided for managing grades. The student can add a grade by entering the grade in a text box, selecting the subject from a combo box, choosing the date using a button that opens a new GUI for date selection, and clicking the add button. Grades can be deleted by selecting them in the table and clicking the delete button.
#### The program includes three buttons that show different panels. The first button is for the school weekly timetable, where the student can enter subjects for each day in a table with 7 columns. The timetable can be saved in the database using a save button. 
#### The second button is for managing subjects, displaying them in a table. The student can add a subject by entering the name and teacher's name in two text boxes and clicking the add button. Subjects can be deleted by selecting them in the table and clicking the delete button.
#### The third button is for managing events, displaying them in a table. The student can add a new event by entering the title and notes in text boxes, selecting the type and subject from combo boxes, choosing the date using a button, and clicking the add button. Events can be deleted by selecting them in the table and clicking the delete button. The student can also edit an event by double-clicking on it, which fills the input fields with the event's values. The student can confirm the changes by clicking the confirm button or add a new event with those values by clicking the add button.

### durata-01.pwk
###### 29/06/23
#### This program generates a graph in a panel based on a table that contains different operations along with their start and end times. The graph visually represents when each operation starts and ends. There's also a vertical line which moves with the cursor, and a label on top of the panel that shows the current time in the vertical line. This program lets the user select a table with a button, and the table will be loaded on the GUI and the database SQL.
